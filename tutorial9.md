Task 4: Display the properties for videos ’Video1.avi’ and ’Video2.avi’. Do you spot any diﬀerences? What are these? and why?

the differences is  FPS,resolution,duration,file frames rate. because the file size and duration are different.

Task 5: Using Matlab help documentation, check the VideoReader supported formats. Download your own video ﬁle and check its properties using the function in Task 3.
