	TASK 3: Reading and displaying display different channel of images.

	TASK 4: Working on individual colour spaces can allow the manipulation of the image attributes. For example,

	TASK 5:You can further apply thresholds to image information or logical operations on single colour channels just like you could on the entire image.

	INDEPENDENT TASK 1:
	• Download an RGB image of your choice 
	• Open the image in Photoshop and check that the image is RGB 
	• Write your own .m ﬁle that applies a threshold to each of the Red, Green and Blue channels of the image and displays all the result images and the original image in ﬁgure windows. 
	• Download more RGB images and test your .m ﬁle • Demonstrate your .m ﬁle to a tutor in the session

	INDEPENDENT TASK 2: 
	• Download an RGB image of your choice 
	• Open the image in Photoshop and check that the image is RGB 
	• Write your own .m ﬁle that applies a random threshold to a random colour channel 
	• For this you are to search in the help for the “rand” function and try to determine how you can use it
	• Remember that your threshold will need to be in the range 0 to 28 −1 
	• Display your random threshold image in a ﬁgure window 
	• Demonstrate your .m ﬁle to a tutor
