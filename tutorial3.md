# Matlab Note


	TASK 1: Sub-Plotting Information displays multiple images within one ﬁgure window using the “subplot” function.

	TASK 2: For example create an .m ﬁle to apply the following code to plot a slice/line of data from a single channel of the image.

	TASK 3: Figures can be used for comparing plots of diﬀerent parameters.

	TASK I1: Create a simple .m ﬁle which reads in an image and then ﬂips the image (left to right), then on this ﬂipped image converts the image into binary BW and displays both the original and the ﬂipped binary image.

	TASK I2: Create a simple .m ﬁle which reads in an RGB image and converts the image to Greyscale, and Binary and displays these in a 1x3 subplot.

	TASK I3: Create a simple .m ﬁle which reads in an RGB image and converts the image to Greyscale. It then takes a slice from row 50 in the image and plots this row in a ﬁgure window.

	TASK I4: Create a simple .m ﬁle which reads in the “pout” image and replicates the following two examples using subplot. i) Showing the image and plotting a slice from column 100 and ii) showing three examples of the image (the original and two threshold levels).
