	TASK 1: Exposure. Use an .m ﬁle in Matlab to create a code that reads in a video ﬁle and then, frame by frame, multiply each pixel’s intensity by a scalar value of your choice

	TASK 2: Brightness. Use an .m ﬁle in Matlab to create a code that reads in a video ﬁle and then, frame by frame, adds to each pixel’s a predeﬁned amount (i.e. see example with +125 below)

![task](src/weak1p/2.png ''xxx'')

	TASK 3: Now display a third video stream in a new column to the right of the current display, displaying the subtraction of a predeﬁned value to each pixel (i.e. -125).

	TASK 4: Following a similar approach as in Task 2 and 3, display the 3 colour intensity channels (R, G, B) side by side on separate video streams. See picture below for further reference.

	TASK 5 Saturation. Change the saturation value of the video ’xylophone.mp4’. A pseudo code is provided below.

	TASK I1: Create a function that returns the average intensity from all pixels in a frame. Plot the values.

	TASK I2: Use the function in TASK I1 to display (side by side) the frame with the highest and the lowest intensity.

	TASK I3: Contrast. Using the function created in TASK I1; create an m ﬁle that changes the contrast of a video. A pseudo code is provided below.

	TASK I4: Convert ’Xylophone.mp4’ video to grayscale.

![task](src/weak1p/9.png ''xxx'')

	TASK I5: Using the Matlab tool VideoWriter, export the grayscale frames from TaskI4 to a new video ﬁle.

	TASK I6: Convert guided tasks (1-5) to functions. These functions will receive 2 input parameters: the video ﬁle-name and the scalar to add/multiply/subtract'

	all the tasks are function.
